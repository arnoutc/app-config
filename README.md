# APP-CONFIG Deploy a file from Github into AWS S3 

## Features

- A Github Action to deploy a JSON file from uploads into an AWS S3 bucket.

## Tech

APP-CONFIG project uses an open source project to transfer the file(s):

- [Upload S3](https://github.com/shallwefootball/upload-s3-action)

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

I used the [Github deploy to Amazon ECS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-amazon-elastic-container-service) page to have a bit of an idea on how to do this.

In the first instance the github deployment works on merging a pull request.
